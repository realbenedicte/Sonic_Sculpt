# Grains4u ~ A Granular Synthesis Sandbox
##built by Matt Herrero

Grains4u is a granular synthesis web application, built using html, css, and Javascript. It leans heavily on Javascript's
Web Audio API for sound recording and sample processing. It is designed to be a sandbox application aimed towards folks
with no knowledge of what granular synthesis is, to start getting their hands dirty with this cool form of sound generation!
