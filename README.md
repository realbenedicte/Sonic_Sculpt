# Grains4u ~ A Granular Synthesis Sandbox

Grains4u is a granular synthesis web application, built using html, css, and Javascript. It leans heavily on Javascript's
Web Audio API for sound recording and sample processing. It is designed as a toy, sandbox application for folks
with no knowledge of granular synthesis, so they can get their hands dirty and play with this cool form of sound generation!
